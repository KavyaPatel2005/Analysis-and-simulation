# Control Arm FEA Analysis

This project involves the static structural analysis of a lower control arm of a suspension system using ANSYS Workbench. The analysis includes deformation, stress, and optimization using AISI 1040 steel. A CAD model was simulated under a load of 750 N to study the structural integrity and weight optimization potential.
