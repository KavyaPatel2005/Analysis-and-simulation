# Thermal and Mechanical CAD Projects

This repository contains a set of mechanical CAD and thermal simulation projects done using Fusion 360 and ANSYS. It focuses on the thermal behavior and cooling performance of components such as disc brakes and heat sinks.

##  Project List

###  Brake Disc Thermal Analysis
Steady-state thermal analysis of a ventilated disc brake to evaluate heat dissipation via convection and radiation.  
 [View Project](./brake_disc/)

### ðŸŒ¡Heat Sink Thermal Analysis
Comparative thermal simulation of a passive aluminum heat sink under uniform and localized heat loading using natural convection.  
 [View Project](./heat_sink/)

###  Lower Control Arm Structural Analysis
Finite element analysis (FEA) of a vehicleâ€™s front lower control arm using AISI 1040 steel. Assesses static deformation, equivalent stress, and factor of safety under a 750 N applied load.
